# capstone_visualizer

******Before running anything, make sure plotly and numpy is installed, and that you have set up your plotly credentials and api keys correctly

# Current Status
Everything(?) is coded. But nothing is fully tested with everything working in tandem yet.

# Next Steps
- Start up main.py on the pi and start testing. Once we get code bugs figured out, it's on to testing the location tracking ability.

# Far off goals
- format the plot to look nicer, have extra titles and whatnot
- make plotted points large enough to account for error in location
- get rid of weird file buffers in code for effeciency sake
